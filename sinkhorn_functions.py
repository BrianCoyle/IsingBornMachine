    This function computes the Sinkhorn Cost function, and its gradient, following the Method of:
    Interpolating between Optimal Transport and MMD using Sinkhorn Divergences by Feydy et. al.
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08278
    
    The functions used from feydy_sinkhorn are those in https://github.com/jeanfeydy/global-divergences in common/sinkhorn_balanced_simple
    to directly compute the Sinkhorn Divergence, and adapted from there to compute its gradient.
