# IsingBornMachine
Implementation of Quantum Ising Born Machine using Rigetti Forest Platform, with two approaches: 
1. Training using MMD as a Cost function.
2. Training using Stein Discrepancy as a Cost function

Both of the above have the option to run using a 'Quantum-Hard' Kernel function

To run the, PyQuil is needed, plus a user code which can be gotten by signing up to use the Rigetti simulator online:

Follow instructions online:
http://docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/start.html
This will allow you to download the Rigetti SDK which includes a compiler and a Quantum Virtual Machine

Also the standard packages, numpy, matplotlib, etc.
