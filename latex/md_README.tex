Implementation of Quantum Ising Born Machine using Rigetti Forest Platform, with two approaches\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Training using M\+MD as a Cost function.
\item Training using Stein Discrepancy as a Cost function
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Both of the above have the option to run using a \textquotesingle{}Quantum-\/\+Hard\textquotesingle{} Kernel function

To run the, Py\+Quil is needed, plus a user code which can be gotten by signing up to use the Rigetti simulator online\+:

Follow instructions online\+: \href{http://docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/start.html}{\tt http\+://docs.\+rigetti.\+com/en/stable/start.\+html} This will allow you to download the Rigetti S\+DK which includes a compiler and a Quantum Virtual Machine

Also the standard packages, numpy, matplotlib, etc.

In the current form of the above codes, it is necessary to run some functions in file\+\_\+operations\+\_\+out.\+py to generate the data and pre-\/compute the quantum kernel etc.
